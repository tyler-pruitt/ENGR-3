Answers to questions:
The runtime for the for loop is always much greater than the runtime for the element wise calculation. As N increases, the differences in the runtimes also increases. The general relationship between the value of N and the length of the runtime is that as N increases, the runtimes also increase. The general quantitative relationship between N and runtime is linear and the for loop runtime has a greater slope than the elementwise calculation.
